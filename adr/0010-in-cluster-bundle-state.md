# 10. In-cluster bundle state

Date: 17 July 2024

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As a user of the UDS-CLI, I want to be able to see the state of my bundles in the cluster so that I can understand what is currently deployed. This information is useful to know before applying upgrades, troubleshooting, removing bundles, etc.

Currently Zarf provides a `package list` command that lists all the packages in the cluster and users would like similar functionality for bundles.

## Options

### Zarf It

### Leverage metadata
