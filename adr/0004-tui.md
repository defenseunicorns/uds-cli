# 4. Terminal User Interface (TUI)

Date: 22 March 2024

## Status
Accepted

## Context
- Today, UDS CLI leverages the `pterm` library and `messaging` pkg in Zarf to provide a terminal user interface (TUI) for  users. The TUI is used to display progress bars, tables, etc to the user. The current implementation of the TUI is tightly coupled with Zarf, making it difficult to customize and address the unique needs of UDS CLI.


- The UDS CLI team has formed the following hypothesis about UDS CLI users: UDS CLI users (particularly those doing `uds deploy`) are more interested in the status of their deployment than the details of the deployment process.


- In an effort to address the unique needs of UDS CLI users, the UDS CLI team would like to decouple UDS CLI from the Zarf TUI in an effort to make a custom user experience for UDS CLI users.

## Decision
The UDS CLI team has decided to refactor the existing TUI implementation with [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and other tools from the [Charm](https://charm.sh/) stack. We believe the Charm stack offers the most advanced and modern tooling for building TUIs in Go.

## Consequences
This refactor is large and will be implemented one `uds` operation at time, starting with operations most likely to be performed during and after bundle installation.
