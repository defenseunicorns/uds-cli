# Contributing to UDS CLI
Welcome :unicorn: to the UDS CLI! If you'd like to contribute, please reach out to one of the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) and we'll be happy to get you started!

Below are some notes on our core software design philosophies that should help guide contributors.

## Code Quality and Standards
Fundamentally, software engineering is a communication problem; we write code for each other, not a computer. When working on this project (or any project!) keep your fellow humans in mind and write clearly and concisely. Below are some general guidelines for code quality and standards that make UDS CLI :sparkles:

- **Write tests that give confidence**: Unless there is a technical blocker, every new feature and bug fix should be tested in the project's automated test suite. Although many of our tests are E2E, unit and integration-style tests are also welcomed. Note that unit tests can live in a `*_test.go` file alongside the source code, and E2E tests live in `src/test/e2e`


- **Prefer readability over being clever**: "I'm old! I don't like complicated things" - @mikevanhemert. We have a strong preference for code readabilty in UDS CLI. Specifically, this means things like: naming variables appropriately, keeping functions to a reasonable size and avoiding complicated solutions when simple ones exist.


- **User experience is paramount**: UDS CLI doesn't have a pretty UI (yet), but the core user-centered design principles that apply when building a frontend also apply to this CLI tool. First and foremost, features in UDS CLI should enhance workflows and make life easier for end users; if a feature doesn't accomplish this, it will be dropped.  

### Pre-Commit Hooks and Linting
In this repo you can optionally use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks for automated validation and linting, but if not CI will run these checks for you.


## Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery is core to our development philosophy. Check out [https://minimumcd.org](https://minimumcd.org/) for a good baseline agreement on what that means.

Specifically:

- We do trunk-based development (`main`) with short-lived feature branches that originate from the trunk, get merged into the trunk, and are deleted after the merge
- We don't merge code into `main` that isn't releasable
- We perform automated testing on all changes before they get merged to `main`
- We create immutable release artifacts
