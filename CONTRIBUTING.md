## Developer Experience
Continuous Delivery is core to our development philosophy. Check out [https://minimumcd.org](https://minimumcd.org/) for a good baseline agreement on what that means.

Specifically:

- We do trunk-based development (`main`) with short-lived feature branches that originate from the trunk, get merged into the trunk, and are deleted after the merge
- We don't merge code into `main` that isn't releasable
- We perform automated testing on all changes before they get merged to `main`
- We create immutable release artifacts
