The [UDS CLI](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-cli) is the primary interface for users to interact with various components within the UDS landscape. It streamlines the deployment process of mission applications and secure infrastructure, simplifying tasks involved in running mission applications while maintaining regulatory compliance in a unified and efficient manner.

The UDS CLI simplifies deployment by bundling multiple Zarf Packages into a single deployable artifact. This process ensures that UDS Bundles, which encompass infrastructure, platform, and mission applications, can be efficiently deployed within any Mission Hero's system environment. Additionally, the UDS CLI extends its capabilities to Pepr, where multiple Pepr applications are bundled and deployed as a single Pepr Module to support UDS Bundles during runtime.
