## Quickstart
UDS-CLI provides a mechanism to bundle and deploy multiple, independent Zarf packages. To create a `UDSBundle` of Zarf packages, create a `uds-bundle.yaml` file like so:

```yaml
kind: UDSBundle
metadata:
  name: example
  description: an example UDS bundle
  version: 0.0.1

packages:
  - name: init
    repository: ghcr.io/defenseunicorns/packages/init
    ref: v0.33.0
    optionalComponents:
      - git-server
  - name: podinfo
    repository: ghcr.io/defenseunicorns/uds-cli/podinfo
    ref: 0.0.1
```
Running `uds create` in the same directory as the above `uds-bundle.yaml` will create a bundle tarball containing both the Zarf init package and podinfo. The bundle can be deployed with `uds deploy`.
